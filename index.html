<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
<p>This website was designed to help<em><strong> refugees and asylum seekers </strong></em>to know how they can live in order to benefit fully in the restricted life they are living into. The hong Kong government does not allow refugees and asylum seekers to work which make refugees and asylum seekers living a life of destitution while many of them have qualification that would enable them get a job and provide for their families.</p>

<p>Today in Hong Kong there are more than 10 thousands of refugees and asylum seekers, some of them have already been here for more than 10 years. This is a form of injustice that the Hong Kong authorities have done to this vulnarable group of people.</p>
