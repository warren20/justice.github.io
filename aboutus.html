About us

This website was designed to help refugees and asylum seekers to know how they can live in order to benefit fully in the restricted life they are living into. The hong Kong government does not allow refugees and asylum seekers to work which make refugees and asylum seekers living a life of destitution while many of them have qualification that would enable them get a job and provide for their families.
